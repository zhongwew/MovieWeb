# Frontend

This directory contains files of frontend development of Project 1. It is created with command tool `create-react-app` provided by [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

Frontend proejct is based on React, a popular SPA(Single Page Application) framework. All pages are managed by React Router 4.0, and flex layout is the main layout of each component. To send Ajax http requests, axios is required. To test frontend codes, mockjs is used to intercept http requests to response dummy data.

## How to run

Note: We have already packaged all frontend files to backend directory `MovieServer/WebContent`. If you run the frontend project, all http requests will be intercepted by Mock.js and responsed with dummy data.

```bash
$ npm install # Install npm dependencies

$ npm start   # Start this frontend project
```

## How to build

**Caveats: This command will wipe out all files of direcotry `MovieServer/WebContent`, and output frontend files. That means some jar files like mysql connector and json jar will be deleted which are supposed to be in directory `MovieServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib` The whole project might won't work any more. What you should do is to create those folders and put jar files in it again!**

```bash
$ npm run build
```
